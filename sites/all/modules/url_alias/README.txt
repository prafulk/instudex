URL Alias allows the import / export of paths to and from Drupal's core 
{url_alias} table. This module keeps the association of URL aliases with 
the associated entity when they are moved between Drupal instances.

This module depends on the UUID module[1]. (Import support currently 
relies on the latest dev build[2]).
